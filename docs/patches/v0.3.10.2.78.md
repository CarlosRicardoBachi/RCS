# Patch v0.3.10.2.78

## Fixed
- GMPR import no longer crashes due to missing ObjectType definition.
- Added defensive fallback when ObjectType enum/class is unavailable.

## Technical
- rcs/core/gmpr_io.py:
  - Safe import of ObjectType
  - Fallback to raw node type with warning log
- rcs/ui/main_window.py:
  - Improved error reporting on GMPR import failure

## Impact
- GMPR projects can be loaded again
- No behavior change for SVG import
- No UI regression

## Risk
Low – changes are isolated to GMPR IO path only.
